19AIE214-Big Data Analysis End Project

## Data
The data consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. This is a large dataset: there are nearly 120 million records in total, and takes up 4 gigabytes of space compressed and 12 gigabytes when uncompressed.

## Challenges
The aim of the data expo is to provide a graphical summary of important features of the data set. This is intentionally vague in order to allow different entries to focus on different aspects of the data, but here are a few ideas to get you started:  

  When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?  
  Do older planes suffer more delays?  
  How well does weather predict plane delays?
